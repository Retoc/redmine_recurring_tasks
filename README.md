Plugin for creating scheduled tasks from templates.

# Installation

* Ruby 2.2+
* Redmine 3.3+
* Standard install plugin:

```
cd {REDMINE_ROOT}
git clone https://github.com/centosadmin/redmine_recurring_tasks.git plugins/redmine_recurring_tasks
bundle install
bundle exec rake redmine:plugins:migrate RAILS_ENV=production
```

# Run

To run copying issues task you should run rake task

```
cd {REDMINE_ROOT}
bundle exec rake redmine_recurring_tasks:exec
```

And to do it periodically you may use cron or another external scheduler.

# Settings

If you have any plugins, which for some reason doesn't copying in spawned issues, you can set specific issue associations fields in plugin settings. But be careful â€” this option can break work plugin scheduler.

For example, if you using plugin *Redmine checklists*, you can check "checklists" in RedmineRecurringTasks settings.
